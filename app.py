    This simulation calculates and visualises the average wait time before a parking spot 
    becomes available in the following setting.
    
    **Assumption:**
    
    We assume there are number of parking spots with constant demand. There is hard limit on 
    the maximum time a car can be parked in a spot. Each parking spot can become available uniformly
    between 0 and the maximum wait time. As soon as a parking spot becomes available, you can park your car.
    
    **Question: Assuming you arrive at a random time and want to park your car, what is the average minimum wait time?**
    
    **How to use this app:**
    
    Adjust the parameters below and click **Run Simulation** to see the animated results. When you start, the simulation
    will run for the number of trials you specify. For each trial, you will see the parking spots availability in the top plot.
    These are the time remaining for each parking spot to become available. The bottom plot shows the minimum wait time
    in blue and the average wait time in red. The average wait time is the average of all minimum wait times up to that point.
    You should see that the average wait time converges to a value as the number of trials increases.
    
    The default parameters are set to 20000 trials, 30 minutes maximum wait time, 4 parking spots, and 1 fast forward steps.
    Running the simulation for 20000 trials may result in the plots looking a bit dense, but is needed to get a good estimate.
    If you want to inspect the plots more closely, you can reduce the number of trials in a separate run.
